# Dataset-of-DDoS-attacks-related-to-IP-entropy

The paper applying this dataset has been submitted to Computer Networks.

This dataset is collected from our prototype system, and it includes more features related to DDoS packets and IP entropy than the features we used in the paper.

This dataset can help researchers to conduct research related to intrusion detection or DDoS attack source tracing.
